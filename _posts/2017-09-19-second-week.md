The article introduces a change in the opinion on data. While we have been prodominately viewing it with great negativity the article introduces a more pleseant view of big data, though the information with it is relatively dark information. Data isn`t evil, or inately bias. The collection methods and the bias of those interpreting them are flawed. The idea of data collected without bias or flaw is a nice one and while relying on search histories does cut out a layer of human fear there is still biased inately in the collection method. 

People don`t always respond to things. 

Passion, strong beliefs, or elevated emotional states prompt people to respond to situations. Someone who has a hateful opinion on any race, religion, or culture is more likely to search negative things about that particular group than someone who is indifferent on the topics or who may even be in support of that group. Data is going to be skewed inevitably. It also varies on the trend of the topic within society. Women in less tollerent states are of course going to be more worried about their husband being gay than cheating because the topic of sexuality is big right now and they have a greater fear of their husbands being gay. 

It is impossible to remove all bias from data collection. Even sifting through search histories there is no context to the searches and not everyone will search about every topic. Subjects will be skewed towards the more passionate and vocal side. Data still has to be fine picked, combed, and interpreted. The issue may not be in the number of negative searches about groups, but rather the lack of positive searches because even if such hate isn`t dominant it is more vocal and that could end up being an even larger problem by instilling divides. This data can be utilized to show the power of voice in the negativity people miss as well as create a sense of openness and perhaps even community by supporting the idea that no one is alone in their questions and/or experiences.

The idea of encouraging intrest and/or research on topics and people with a more positive conotation, educating the population on this data, and confronting fears and worries with this data to work on reshaping society in the article are all positive goals. Using data to realize the greater impact of positivity in the article also sounds like a much better solution than preaching about hate that may be more vocally dominant but not so physically prevalent. I like the idea introduced of inspiring compassion while denouncing hate because hate may be more prevalent or compassion could just be lacking.
