The YouTube algorithm has multiple times been pointed out for its extreme flaws. Trying to play the system is like grasping at straws which definitely feeds these demented videos that filter in. YouTube also has a major issue with censoring content that should not be censored and allowing other things to go unnoticed by viewers and any moderators. I think Bridle is wrong to brush off the small channels in fear of the larger ones because it is the large channels that get caught, who will be shut down if they break any of the increasingly strict guidelines. 

Bridle's concern that this is both human and machine is also a valid one. Blaming algorithms alone is senseless. Videos like those produced by Don't Hug Me I'm Scared are disturbing content not built around an algorithm, but by people. It initially appears as a child's cartoon but rapidly warps into something much more demented. The algorithm just managed to pick up these dark and twisted videos that probably didn't even attend to impact children. I watched a video on the rise of the Finger Family trend called Down the Rabbit Hole and even the videos produced by people initially, that were swept up by YouTube's algorithm had an unsettling factor to them in their poor and repetitive quality over several channels until the algorithm hooked onto them. 

YouTube's algorithm doesn't need to become something of concern because it already is. This is a long-standing issue. Filling a set list can be easy once you figure the list out allowing things that shouldn't get through manage to get through and become widely viewed. Who cares about a kid or too if you can pull some money from it? If you don't get too popular you won't be caught and if you know how to play the system you can find that balance to earn money, especially with multiple YouTube channels, building until you attract attention like the person that started the Finger Family trend. 

I have yet to be thrown into the wrong side of YouTube, but perhaps thatâ€™s because I am naturally looking for a certain level of dark and twisted content and I don't usually watch suggested videos. There is a wrong side of YouTube though and just that fact is concerning but should be expected to a degree; it is the ease with which it can be accessed unintentionally that is the real problem.
