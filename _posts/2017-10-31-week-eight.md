Von Shoshana Zuboff's article that made me think of Elbunit's point in class, that the data eventually joins to the system. In this case it feeds and forms a new type of capitalism that is stripping humans of certain rights and dignities. The data functions more as a tool for the system rather than for agency. Still all of this connects back to how data is being untilized and by who as well as generall access to the gathered data.

Bossewitch and Sinnereich see data more as a tool with many uses. Data does not have agency in itself, nor does it create the system society is in. Data can be utilized, withheld or stratigically released and stored, to serve as a tool for agency or for the system depending on just how it is released and just who has a hold on it. Agency requires a level of conciousness which data can provide, but Bossewitch and Sinnereich point out that utilizing data varies on how and who is intepretting it. A tool in the hands of someone who can't figure out how to use it is useless and can even be dangerous. They go over a multitude of ways to utilize data for agency, but the key factor is always the same and it is the conciousness of the person storing or providing the data concerning both the data they are storing and also the data they are releasing. 

Both readings seem to agree with Elbunit's point that data can just add to a system, but adding to the system alters it. What is the point of agency if not to eventually alter the system? After reading these articles I almost feel like agency is meant to flow in cycles, providing an escape in the system to eventually alter the system only to arise again centered on other flaws and problems. We choose how we interpret and use data thus we utilize this tool as we see fit so if we desire to find some means for agency data then it very well can be used that way, it just takes some work to gain the needed conciousness.
