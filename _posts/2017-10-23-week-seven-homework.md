Weiser speaks almost obsesively about the computer being ubiquitous, data collection being constant, but does not touch the topic of privacy until the end. He emphasizes the data collection greatly benefitting everyone, allowing technology to be personalized based on something as simple as location. It is only at the end of his article that he suggest privacy may very easily be ruined due to people intercepting others information or the information flowing to companies hands and even then he brushes it off with a simple solution as if things really are so simple. He aknowlegedes the storage of data in limited locations, yet seems oblivious to those who own these storage locations. 

Weiser envisions a world where computers are ubiquitous, but they become even more than that in his world. In modern society, without having a computer in every book or on every wall, computers have become ubiquitous. We have smartphones, tablets, personal laptops, smart cars, smart tvs, and more. We can be tracked by phones. In schools key cards keep an eye on student movement. We can share files or even screens through skype calls. We are already so heavily tracked in what we do, what we like, what we search up without all the extra technology Weiser gives. In his world down to sleeping habits are watched by computers and trigger a change. The data is also more eaily accesed by everyone. Our world is similar, but there are more limits in the speceficity of data and not everyone has open access. 

A major difference between the real world and Weiser`s future is access to data. Big companies essentially have a monopoly on data, buying and selling it to their bennefit, targetting adds and suggesting different search results based on previous searches. Weiser`s future is far more unrealistic. The data is mostly open to public access and what is in company hands isn`t adressed at all as if it has no impact. Computers are ubiquitous in modern society, almost even more than that, but in Weiser`s world they completely rule. 

What we have achieved is very close to Weiser`s world and that is actually rather terrifying. The major difference is the lack of public access to data and it is difficult to determine if that is exactly a negative thing. There is no line in data collection in Weiser`s world and I hope we don`t draw too much closer to that because, just as there needs to be with most things, a line needs to be drawn.
