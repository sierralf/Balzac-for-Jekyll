Both lacking any coding experience beyond what we had in class we wanted to test our limits without aiming for something unrealistic. We decided to pull all the links, order them in a neat list, and count the links. We were trying to get an idea of just how much information is laying hidden across the page in the form of links ready to send us to different location. We also wanted to get an idea of just how much the page throws at users to keep their attention and interact with them. The number of links turns out to be astounding. We then decided to check for any links that may send us off sight by removing any links that had DeviantArt mentioned within them. To our surprise the few links that did not contain DeviantArt did not send us off site either, simply to a section where art can be made directly on the site.  We had to comment out part of our setup for finding all links, but left it there to show some of our work as well as the other uses we got from the code. 
  
On the topic of pulling information we also tested the code for pulling strings. We ran it several times alone and with the other functions to try and get an idea of what it did. We also edited it some to see if we could change the results. We couldn't fully figure it out, but we got some idea of the code and found rather incredible results. 
  
The code pulled a lot of information off the page, including things that weren't directly visible on the page. It pulled pieces of the story, the story stats (number of favorites, number of views, number of comments and such), and features shown on the page, but the really cool thing is that it pulled excerpts from the suggested stories on the side that can't really be read directly on the actual page. We don't believe we have used this code to its full potential or extent, but as neither of us have any real coding experience what we managed to do kind of amazes us. It is incredible all that only a few words and symbols can do when organized right. We did comment this code out as it did print a large and dense result that hid the rest of our work.
