Lucy came up with the initial idea of pulling punctuation to watch the rise and fall of a story and we worked together to come up with the idea of comparing the rise and fall of stories stretching across several different genres. We chose books that are well known, or at least popular enough to have a pdf file, as well as stories we thought represented their genre well, though Lucy has pointed out "Silent Spring" was essentially a first in that stretch of non-fiction dirrected to the common people and thus may not be the best representative of enviromental science non-fiction. Lucy did the work of downloading the pdf files and then tranforming them to text files which she then sent to me. 

 We entered this project anxiously as coding was far from our strength and we feared a complex code would be necessary in order to pull the punctutation from the text files. As I was the one in charge of the code it felt like an intese weight to bear. Still, as a writer and as a strong contributer to the idea, I was set on making this work. Below is the code which is suprisingly simple. Luckily for me a person in my house, Matt Jones, has experience coding and was willing to help. Most of his help was basic guidance and explainging to me what I was typing when I got confused resulting in my coming up with the code in the majority on my own (and by on my own I mean about two hours of searching Google and YouTube until I understood what I was doing). In the end the result and the amount I managerd to do by myself left me elated, though the simplicity does leave me a bit emberassed that it took so much effort to figure out. I feel that in the end it did help me understand coidng, even if only a little.

We ran the code and found the results to be astounding. The amoung of punctuation was far beyond what we had expected. We discovered other projects that pulled punctuation from well known books and put them in spirals in our research, but those projects only had a fraction of the punctuation we had in the end. Using Google.drive I shared the punctuation with Lucy and, after her slight editting in font and spacing, we discovered each book to have about a page and a half worth of punctuation in Times New Roman 12 pt font. Putting that in a word document, that means each story has over 8,000 pieces of punctuation. "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" had the least punctuatrion at 8,401 and "Silent Spring" had the most at 9,861 which almost seems insane. We did expect "Silent Spring" to have the most punctuation, but were utterly suprised that "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" came in last by quiet a bit as we expected the fantasy genre as well as the time of writing to lead to a punctuation heavy piece.

I've included pictures of a section from each text file yet they still fail to put into prospective the massive portion of text that consist of punctuation. I wouldn't be suprised if the amount of punctuation surpass the number of uses of most words in each novel including that of the name of a main character. Punctuation is powerful. Another shocking factor is the diversity of punctuation in each story. "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Fever 1793" keep up with the diversity of punctuation of "Silent Spring" despite the latter being a scientific non-fiction book. We can't even tell periods from ellipses leaving the punctuation as much up to reader interpretation as the actual text. The diversity and ambiguity of punctuation creates a multi-purpose tool that can breath more meaning into a piece than most words can.

The amount of punctuation was just far too much to stretch out all three books over a poster. The result would be a monster of paper that more than likely stretches all the way around the room, thus Lucy pulled the first one thousand pieces of punctuation and the last one thousand pieces of punctuation from each book and got them printed on a poster, stacking the books for easier comparrison. The sheer amount of data, even when reduced and condensed, was almost overwhelming and was certainly breathtaking to look at. Even now I enjoy looking back at the posture and punctuation. The books are so different and so similar at the same time giving punctuation varying meaning over genres and yet speaking similarly between them as well.

We are left with so many more dirrections to go and so many new questions to try out. How does punctuation differe in different time periods? How does punctuation change and show the growth of an author, or does it even change? Can punctuation stretch over languages and writing systems? The ability for exploration is endless. Punctuation is a timeline, a piece of text, a language of its own, and a multi-purpose tool for both writers and readers and our project can explore that a little if those looking at it choose to let it.
