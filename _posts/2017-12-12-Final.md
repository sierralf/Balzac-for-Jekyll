For my final I wished to address the colloquialisms used around and away from campus to express their impact on speech as well as identity. I recall at the beginnin of term talk about the inability to properly communicate because no word means the same thing to any two people. Utilizing the power of words in the form of poems I wanted to grant a window into the world of speech at Bennington. I also wished to express lost speech at Bennington in my final peom written with the help of Alex Ray, my friend from the VI who is faced with code switching when he comes here. 

I compiled a list of about 80 personal colloquialisms and 80 Bennington colloquialisms allowing for repeats. It was a struggle as many students did not realize their colloquialisms or put down items that may not be colloquialisms. Due to my desire to explore how students here comprehend language I left in everything that people considered colloquialisms. From these list of colloquialisms as well as colloquialisms of my own I developed several poems. 

I did not use the code as much as expected. It is very troublesome using a code inorder to compile words to use for poems with very specific rhyme schemes or word patterns. Of the poems produced three contain entirely randomly generated poems. With many poems I chose the words in order to play with them and test around with their meaning. The sestina is perhaps the most impactful as the words and phrases that had been randomly generated from each list get transformed to mean many different things. 

Colloquialisms aren`t terrible things, in fact they are great. People struggle to understand them yet they are a bridge in communication at the same time. They also appear quite frequently, yet in their overlap they may come with different meanings. Their flexability gave me a lot of room to work with them and the more I worked with them the more it came through the people and their understanding created the issue as well as human biases. 

I ended up changing slightly in my project as I worked through it, built upon colloquialisms in the final poem all the way to personal dialect and the ignorance of people. With the help of my friend from the VI we formulated a cleave poem expressing the struggles we have had with our colloquialisms and dialect. We also, in this, grew to understand the greater overlaps and found links between colloquialisms that shine through gently in the entire work. 

In the end it is not the colloquialisms that create a problem. They are so few and yet so many at the same time, such as the three seperate words for cigarette. The issue boils down to perception or the inabiltity to percieve these colloquialisms and the overlap that doesn`t line up just right. Even the small list I gathered was shot through with repeats on both sides and was a fight to get, and never before have I used Urabn Dictionary so heavily for a school project. The overall borderline nonsensical poems that resulted give a strong expression of the diversity and incomprehensibility that occurs with such a wide array of language. It all still leaves me wondering just how we manage to communicate as well as we do, or do we even communicate as well as we think. 

Overall I greatly enjoyed the project and its outcome. I would love a much stronger list of colloquialisms and perhaps even poems made by people using their own colloquialisms to present a greater difference between the language they grew up with and the language used at Bennington.
